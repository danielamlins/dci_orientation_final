# Welcome!

This Project is a business card template for a website, designed to be used by a Pet Sitter service. On this website, the user will be able to have some information about the team, about the services, as well as see a contact form, reviews and blog articles. As a template, it does not include any JavaScrypt or back-end code.

In this file, I will explain the code source and how this website works.



## Running Locally:

For the purpose of this template, either open index.html with any recent browser or serve it locally with Visual Studio Code function "Live Code". For the latter, open the index.html file on VS Code and click [alt+L alt+O]. It will open on the default browser.

## Technologies

For this Project, I used HTML and CSS.

## Source Structure

This source is organized in 3 html files, an image folder and a CSS folder.

### Index.html

This is the Homepage. It is divided in multiple sections.

The first section is the navbar. The first four links are bookmark jumps designed to go to the other sessions of the homepage. The second session is the "welcome" session, which is composed of a "Hero Shot" with very summarized information about the service. The "about" and "services" sessions are designed to inform the user about the team (people, experiences, etc) and the services provided (for example, pet sitting, dog walking, oral medication administration, etc), respectively. The last session is designed to provide the user with contact information and it also presents a form so the user can contact the team. This form lacks a back-end code, so it does not have any action as of this moment. The purpose of the contact form is so the user/ client can talk with the team, as it is usually necessary for this type of service a talk to the client and the pet sitter to know each other, the animal and so on. Therefore, a simple "booking" process would not suffice.

### Reviews.html

Page designed to provide the user with some reviews, in order to increase the trust for the service provided. If deemed necessary and possible, the contact of these former clients can be provided upon further request.

### Blog.html

This is the template for a blog. It does not have any Back-end code or database as of the moment, and therefore the articles are examples. The idea of the blog is that the user can deepen their knowledge about the subject, as well as to show the expertise of the provider on the subject. The "Most Common Dog Breeds in Germany" and the "Most Common Cat Breeds in Germany" articles' information are taken from the website linked as source. The same applies to the table information.

### CSS

On the style.css file all the styles for the html pages are set.

### Images

Inside the img folder, there is a Images_sources.pdf file, which gives credit to the respectiv sources of the pictures used. All the pictures are free of royalties.
